# RubicksKube
The solution consists of two projects (Class library and unit tests)

Objects Hierarchy
 - Cube
  - CubeLine
    - CubeElement (Set of blocks)
      - CubeUnit
        - UnitFace (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
          - FaceSide
          - Color (System.Drawing.Color)
  - CubeRow
    - CubeElement (Set of blocks)
      - CubeUnit
        - UnitFace (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
          - FaceSide
          - Color (System.Drawing.Color)

I started with not the best approach and when I realised it, I did not have much time left to fix it.
