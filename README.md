# RubicksKube
The solution consists of two projects (Class library and unit tests)

Objects Hierarchy
 - Cube
   - CubeLine
     - CubeElement (Set of blocks)
       - CubeUnit
         - UnitFace 
           - FaceSide (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
           - Color (System.Drawing.Color)
   - CubeRow
     - CubeElement (Set of blocks)
       - CubeUnit
         - UnitFace 
           - FaceSide (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
           - Color (System.Drawing.Color)

I started with not the best approach and when I realised it, I did not have much time left to fix it.
